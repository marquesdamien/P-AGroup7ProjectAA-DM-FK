Group 7 P&A Group Project

For our group Project we are thinking of doing a workout catalog/ tracker. We will have a register and login options for users to create an account. 
They will then be able to create, read, update delete for workouts, which will be a form they fill out with workout details like Date of workout, workout type, creator of workout, and work out details. 
We may change around or update the actual naming convetions for the details in the database table for workouts. 
We will include validations on Registering, logging in, work out form submission. We will also include protected routes for Edit, create and delete work out routes but allow access to any user, 
even if not logged in, to see others work outs.
